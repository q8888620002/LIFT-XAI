Consistent with overall ACCORD findings and current guidelines, markers of advanced vascular and renal disease, higher autonomic stress, and complex comorbidity tend to identify patients in whom intensive glycemic targets are more likely to be harmful or at least not beneficial. In contrast, patients with more favorable metabolic profiles (less atherogenic dyslipidemia, preserved kidney function, lower resting HR) may experience less excess harm from intensive control, though clear net CV benefit is not established within ACCORD\u2019s follow-up. Lipid variables form a correlated cluster, likely capturing underlying metabolic phenotypes rather than independent causal modifiers. All proposed mechanisms remain hypothesis-generating, and any apparent treatment-effect heterogeneity should be validated and carefully contextualized before influencing individual treatment decisions.",
