  "summary": "The current hypotheses are generally well-grounded in diabetes\u2013cardiovascular trial physiology and ACCORD/ADVANCE/VADT experience. Most mechanisms are plausible and appropriately labeled in terms of evidence strength but can be tightened by: (1) distinguishing short-term vs legacy (long-term) effects; (2) clarifying when we are extrapolating beyond trial-era therapies; (3) being more precise about which outcomes (nonfatal MI, stroke, CV death, all-cause mortality, severe hypoglycemia) each mechanism most strongly influences; and (4) making subgroup cut-points and validation plans more concrete and aligned with typical trial data structures. Below are per-feature reviews and a fully revised, slightly sharpened hypothesis set that preserves the strengths while improving specificity, plausibility, and actionability.",

Patients with reduced eGFR have higher risk of severe and prolonged hypoglycemia and substantial competing non-CV mortality. As a result, the incremental macrovascular benefit of very intensive glycemic control may be attenuated in CKD, while harm from hypoglycemia and drug toxicity is magnified, especially for eGFR <45\u201360 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2.",
