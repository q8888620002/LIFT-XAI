  "summary": "This evaluation assesses the mechanisms underlying the impact of various lipid-related features on cardiovascular outcomes under intensive glucose control in a high-risk type 2 diabetes population. Cholesterol (chol), LDL, BMI, and VLDL are examined for their respective mechanistic plausibility, evidence alignment, and practical implications in stratifying risk and tailoring interventions.",
