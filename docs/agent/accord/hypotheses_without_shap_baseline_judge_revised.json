  "summary": "Overall, the feature hypotheses are grounded in established clinical insights and have significant implications for tailoring diabetic cardiovascular risk management. Baseline HbA1c and Renal Function (eGFR) are particularly well-supported by evidence and align with known clinical practices, deserving higher follow-up priority. Collectively, these hypotheses emphasize individualized treatment based on quantifiable patient differences, enhancing decision-making in diabetes care. However, further consideration on testability and subgroup clarity could enhance translation into practice.",
