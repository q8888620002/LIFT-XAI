  "summary": "Across the four evaluated features, the mechanistic reasoning is biologically and clinically coherent, closely aligned with major trial evidence (UKPDS, ACCORD, ADVANCE, VADT, DCCT/EDIC, CKD literature), and translated into clear, actionable subgroup and validation proposals. Caveats are generally appropriate and nuanced. The main concerns are occasional overreach in strength of evidence for some mechanisms (e.g., overtreatment at low HbA1c, some inflammatory/thrombotic claims), and the need to more explicitly acknowledge correlations and potential residual confounding when interpreting effect modification. Overall, these are high-quality, trial-relevant hypotheses that merit high-priority follow-up analyses.",
