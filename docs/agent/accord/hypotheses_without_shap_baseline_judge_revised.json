  "summary": "After evaluating the feature hypotheses, 'Baseline HbA1c' emerges as the most critical feature due to its strong biological plausibility and consistent alignment with clinical evidence, hence receiving the top priority for follow-up. Other features like 'Age' and 'Duration of Diabetes' also show solid foundational evidence but require further clarity in subgroup implications and validation plans. A comprehensive assessment reveals that while each feature has strengths in specific domains, methodological concerns could arise from potential overlapping effects and confounders not fully addressed in the hypotheses.",
