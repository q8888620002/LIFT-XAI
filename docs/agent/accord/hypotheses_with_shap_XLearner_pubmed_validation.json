          "key_findings": "In 56 Chinese patients with T2DM randomized to low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) or low-fat diet (LFD) education for 3 months, LCD led to a greater decrease in HbA1c than LFD (-0.63% vs -0.31%, p<0.05); both groups had reduced fasting blood glucose and insulin dose vs baseline, but only the LCD group showed significant reductions in BMI and total cholesterol at 3 months. Authors conclude LCD improves blood glucose more than LFD, regulates blood lipids, reduces BMI, and decreases insulin dose.",
