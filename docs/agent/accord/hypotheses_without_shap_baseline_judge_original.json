  "summary": "All ten feature-level hypotheses are clinically and mechanistically well-motivated for intensive vs standard glucose control in high CV\u2011risk type 2 diabetes. Interpretation of variables is generally accurate, mechanisms are consistent with major trial data (UKPDS, ACCORD, ADVANCE, VADT), and validation plans are methodologically appropriate. The main cross-cutting limitations are (1) frequent reliance on correlated constructs (age, duration, complications) without fully disentangling them, (2) some mechanisms and subgroup thresholds being extrapolations rather than trial-validated, and (3) limited attention to multiplicity and overfitting when testing many interactions. Overall, these hypotheses deserve medium\u2011to\u2011high priority for follow\u2011up, with greatest immediate value in ASCVD history, duration, age, renal function, prior severe hypoglycemia, and baseline insulin use.",
