  "summary": "Across these 10 ACCORD feature hypotheses, the biological and clinical reasoning is generally strong, particularly for age, kidney function (creatinine), BMI, and the major lipid fractions. Evidence alignment is best where there is established literature on treatment effect heterogeneity (age, CKD, some BMI) and weaker for race and some behavioral/statistical mechanisms. Validation plans are consistently concrete, with appropriate emphasis on interaction testing, spline modeling, and replication. The largest cross-cutting concern is multicollinearity among lipid measures, risk of over-interpreting small SHAP effects, and the post\u2011hoc nature of subgroup inference in ACCORD, a trial with an overall harmful intensive arm. Overall, most features merit medium\u2011priority follow\u2011up; age and kidney function are closest to high\u2011priority given strong external evidence, while race/ethnicity should be approached cautiously due to sociostructural confounding and risk of misinterpretation.",
