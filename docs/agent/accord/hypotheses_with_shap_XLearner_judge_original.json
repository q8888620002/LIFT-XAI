  "summary": "This evaluation assesses mechanistic hypotheses for cardiovascular risk modification in a high-risk diabetic population undergoing intensive glucose control. Strong clinical relevance is seen with cholesterol and LDL, consistent with literature, but methodological rigor varies across features. Cholesterol is a well-validated modifier with sound ranking, while VLDL and anticoagulant use demonstrate lower alignment with established modifiers.",
