  "summary": "In the evaluation of pre-hospital TXA administration's effect on survival among trauma patients, features such as injury type, time since injury, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), and others play significant roles. Notably, injury type and time since injury are higher-ranked in importance, suggesting that specific injury profiles and the timing relative to injury are crucial determinants of TXA efficacy. Additionally, classical physiological parameters such as GCS, age, heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure, although less important individually, collectively contribute to treatment effect variability.",
