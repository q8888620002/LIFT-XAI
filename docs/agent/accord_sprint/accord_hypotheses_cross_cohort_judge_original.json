  "summary": "The hypotheses are analyzed with respect to their proposed mechanisms and clinical implications. Statin use ranks as the most critical feature due to its well-established role in cardiovascular protection, aligning well with trial context and supporting evidence base. Other features like fasting plasma glucose and aspirin use also receive strong scores. Lesser-supported factors like race and gender need more targeted investigation due to higher complexity and speculative evidence, while notes of confounding demand careful interpretation. Prioritized recommendations are formed based on the strength of current validation and clinical utility aspects.",
