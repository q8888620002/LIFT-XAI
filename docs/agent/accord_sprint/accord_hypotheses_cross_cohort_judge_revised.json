  "summary": "The evaluation of feature hypotheses from the ACCORD trial data indicates varying degrees of alignment with clinical knowledge and potential for contributing to treatment decision-making. Features like 'statin' and 'fpg' show strong evidence support and alignment with known modifiers for cardiovascular outcomes. However, considerations around existing trial constraints, evidence gaps, and need for subgroup-specific validation were crucial in determining scores and follow-up priorities.",
