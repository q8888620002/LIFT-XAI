Key modifiers are markers of baseline cardiovascular/renal damage (CKD, LVH, prior CVD, high pulse pressure), vascular/hemodynamic phenotype (SBP, DBP, PP combinations), and physiological reserve and vulnerability (age, frailty, cognitive status), as well as implementation factors (baseline treatment intensity). Features mostly function as integrative proxies for underlying pathology and competing risks, rather than strictly causal effect modifiers. Trial-based evidence supports these patterns qualitatively, but robust causal claims about heterogeneity require careful modeling of achieved BP, component outcomes, adverse events, and competing risks, along with replication in external datasets.",

(1) Markers of higher baseline vascular and structural damage (CKD, LVH, prior CVD, high pulse pressure, older age) predict higher *absolute* benefit from intensive BP lowering but also higher susceptibility to harms (AKI, hypotension, perfusion deficits); most do not clearly change relative risk reduction. (2) Measures of physiological reserve and vulnerability (frailty, low DBP, cognitive impairment, very old age) appear central in determining how safely intensive targets can be implemented, with frailty and orthostatic tendencies particularly important for fall and syncope risk. (3) Vascular phenotype features (combinations of SBP, DBP, PP, LVH, CAD) often interact: high SBP with low DBP and high PP plus LVH or CAD suggests a narrow therapeutic window. (4) Implementation-related features (baseline number of antihypertensive classes, adherence proxies) shape how fully an intensive strategy is realized in practice and how adverse events accumulate, highlighting that some apparent heterogeneity reflects differences in *delivered* rather than assigned treatment. Overall, effect modification is likely modest on the relative scale but meaningful on the absolute scale, and arises from joint patterns of vascular burden, reserve, and treatment implementation rather than from any single variable in isolation."
