  "summary": "Most feature-level hypotheses are conceptually strong and well-aligned with SPRINT-like physiology, but several mechanisms overstate evidence strength, blur short- vs long-term effects, or treat proxy markers (age, pulse pressure, frailty) as if they were direct causal modifiers. I refine them by (1) tightening biological plausibility with more specific cardiovascular/renal details, (2) adjusting evidence levels to better match trial/epidemiologic support, (3) clarifying that most modifiers alter net benefit via baseline risk, vulnerability, and competing risks rather than changing the relative risk reduction dramatically, (4) making subgroup cutpoints more clinically aligned with guidelines and SPRINT, and (5) proposing more targeted and feasible validation analyses, including focus on achieved BP, early vs late hazards, and component outcomes. Caveats are expanded to emphasize limited power for interaction tests and the risk of overinterpreting observational patterns (e.g., DBP J-curve, cognitive decline).",

(2) Measures of physiological reserve and vulnerability (frailty, low DBP, cognitive impairment, very old age) appear central in determining how safely intensive targets can be implemented, with frailty and orthostatic tendencies particularly important for fall and syncope risk. (3) Vascular phenotype features (combinations of SBP, DBP, PP, LVH, CAD) often interact: high SBP with low DBP and high PP plus LVH or CAD suggests a narrow therapeutic window. (4) Implementation-related features (baseline number of antihypertensive classes, adherence proxies) shape how fully an intensive strategy is realized in practice and how adverse events accumulate, highlighting that some apparent heterogeneity reflects differences in *delivered* rather than assigned treatment. Overall, effect modification is likely modest on the relative scale but meaningful on the absolute scale, and arises from joint patterns of vascular burden, reserve, and treatment implementation rather than from any single variable in isolation."
