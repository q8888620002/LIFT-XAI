Main refinements focus on: (1) tightening claims to what SPRINT actually showed vs extrapolations; (2) clarifying which mechanisms are prognostic vs truly predictive; (3) specifying clinically actionable cutpoints and combinations; (4) strengthening validation plans with more concrete modeling strategies and sensitivity analyses; and (5) adding caveats around measurement, selection, and correlated features. No mechanisms are outright implausible, but several are over-specified relative to available evidence and are downgraded to weaker evidence or reframed more cautiously.",

(2) Organ perfusion and reserve: eGFR, creatinine, DBP, CKD subgroup, and n_agents jointly encode renal and hemodynamic reserve. Constellations such as low eGFR/CKD + low DBP + high n_agents identify patients at high risk of AKI and hypotension, in whom the net benefit of intensive control is most uncertain and likely non-monotonic. (3) Vascular stiffness and pulse pressure: Age, SBP, DBP, and lipid profile (higher total cholesterol, lower HDL) all contribute to arterial stiffness phenotypes. High SBP with low DBP in older adults reflects wide pulse pressure and may define a J-curve-sensitive group where over-lowering DBP under intensive therapy could be harmful. (4) Treatment intensity and pharmacologic burden: n_agents, CKD status, age, and sex influence both how aggressively BP can be lowered and how well multi-drug regimens are tolerated, affecting the realized difference between intensive and standard arms. (5) Metabolic health and lifestyle: HDL and total cholesterol, in conjunction with sex and age, differentiate more vs less metabolically adverse risk profiles; these interact with BP and renal features to shape where intensive BP control offers the greatest incremental benefit. Future modeling should explicitly examine multi-way interactions such as age \u00d7 eGFR/CKD \u00d7 SBP/DBP and SBP \u00d7 DBP \u00d7 lipid profile to delineate clinically actionable subgroups with clearly favorable vs borderline benefit\u2013harm profiles for intensive BP control."
