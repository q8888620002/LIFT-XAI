  "summary": "While each feature demonstrates some degree of biological plausibility and evidence support, differences exist in the degree to which they align with existing cardiovascular literature and their potential implications for subgroup definitions and clinical practice. Most notably, the importance rankings often reflect clinical understanding where age and kidney function factors like eGFR are well-documented modifiers, likely justifying their higher ranks. Other features, such as DBP and serum creatinine, also have reasonable rationale but their practical implications should be further examined, particularly concerning how aggressive treatments interact with these features. Cholesterol's role is understood, but its lower ranking is appropriate given the primary context of a blood pressure-focused trial.",
