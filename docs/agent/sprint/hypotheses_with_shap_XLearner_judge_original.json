  "summary": "Across all 10 SPRINT feature hypotheses, mechanisms are biologically coherent, clinically well interpreted, and generally well aligned with existing hypertension and BP-lowering trial literature. Validation suggestions are concrete and methodologically appropriate. The main cross-cutting weaknesses are: (1) occasional drift into generic \u201chigher baseline risk \u2192 more absolute benefit\u201d arguments without always distinguishing prognostic vs truly predictive effects; (2) some mechanisms that are plausible but weakly evidenced (especially behavioral and more subtle biological pathways); and (3) frequent collinearity among renal features (eGFR, serum creatinine, sub_ckd) and among hemodynamic features (SBP, DBP, n_agents) that will complicate clean attribution. Overall this is a strong, trial-consistent mechanistic set; the highest-priority follow-up features for treatment effect heterogeneity work are age, eGFR/sub_ckd, SBP, and DBP, plus n_agents as a pragmatic marker of resistant hypertension and polypharmacy.",
