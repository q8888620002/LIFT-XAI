  "summary": "Across these ten SPRINT feature hypotheses, the mechanistic reasoning is generally sophisticated, clinically accurate, and well-aligned with hypertension/SPRINT literature. Age, eGFR/renal measures, SBP/DBP, and CKD subgroup definitions are especially strong. Lipid and sex hypotheses are somewhat more speculative as true treatment-effect modifiers but still plausible as risk markers. Validation plans are detailed and methodologically sound, with good attention to nonlinearity, competing risks, and mediation. Caveats are comprehensive, acknowledging confounding, collinearity, and generalizability limits. Overall, age, eGFR, DBP, SBP, and CKD status warrant highest priority for follow-up analyses; creatinine and n_agents are medium priority; lipids (chr, hdl) and sex are lower priority as effect modifiers though important prognostically.",
