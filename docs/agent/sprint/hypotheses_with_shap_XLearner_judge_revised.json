  "summary": "The evaluated feature hypotheses all relate to well-known cardiovascular risk factors and their influence on the effectiveness of intensive blood pressure control in non-diabetic hypertensive patients. Age and eGFR are particularly consistent with strong biological mechanisms and evidence from literature, whereas features like cholesterol ratio (CHR) receive lower scores due to less direct influence in intensive blood pressure strategies according to current clinical knowledge. Overall, these hypotheses provide a solid foundation for exploring treatment heterogeneity, though each has specific caveats and validation challenges.",
