  "summary": "The evaluation of hypothesized features from the model for predicting treatment effects of intensive blood pressure control on cardiovascular outcomes yielded differential strengths based on their biological plausibility, evidence support, and alignment with clinical literature. Features such as age and baseline cardiovascular risk showed stronger alignment with established literature and biological reasoning, while chronic kidney disease and body mass index were rated lower due to mismatches in evidence ranking and complexity of interactions not fully captured by existing knowledge. Sex, although biologically plausible, introduces complexities that require further comprehensive analysis to understand its full implications. Recommendations for follow-up prioritize features like age and baseline cardiovascular risk for further exploration due to their clearer evidence and practical potential for guiding personalized treatment decisions.",
