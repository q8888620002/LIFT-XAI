  "summary": "This evaluation involved assessing mechanistic hypotheses for five features affecting intensive blood pressure control outcomes in non-diabetic adults with hypertension. Feature hypotheses were evaluated on mechanism plausibility, evidence alignment, subgroup implications, caveat awareness, and the strength of the validation plan. Age and CKD emerged as top features with strong underlying mechanisms and substantial evidence support, aligning well with literature. Other features, like smoking status, presented valid biological and behavioral mechanisms but with weaker evidence support. Recommendations for each feature were made based on its scientific robustness and clinical relevance.",
