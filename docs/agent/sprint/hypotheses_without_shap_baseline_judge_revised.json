  "summary": "All ten feature-level hypotheses are clinically sophisticated, biologically coherent, and generally well-aligned with current hypertension/intensive BP control literature (including SPRINT-like settings). The proposed mechanisms are mostly plausible and specific, with appropriate caveats and validation strategies. The main cross-cutting weaknesses are: (1) many mechanisms are framed at a conceptual level without quantitative expectations; (2) some overlap and redundancy between correlated features (SBP, DBP, PP, LVH, age, CKD, frailty) makes it hard to isolate independent modification; and (3) several speculative mechanisms lack clear, separately testable predictions. Overall, these are high-quality hypotheses that merit medium-to-high priority follow-up, with emphasis on features that map most directly onto well-documented heterogeneity: CKD, prior CVD, frailty, LVH, and pulse pressure.",
