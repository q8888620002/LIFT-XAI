  "summary": "Across all 10 features, the mechanistic hypotheses are biologically coherent, clinically sophisticated, and largely consistent with the hypertension/intensive BP control literature (e.g., SPRINT-like context). Subgroup proposals and validation plans are generally concrete and methodologically sound. The main cross-cutting limitations are: (1) some mechanisms are necessarily speculative or multifactorial but are usually labeled as such; (2) several modifiers are highly correlated (age, CKD, frailty, pulse pressure, LVH), complicating isolation of independent effect modification; and (3) some proposed analyses (e.g., causal forests, IV) may be ambitious for many trial datasets. Overall, these are high-quality, high-priority hypotheses suitable for rigorous follow-up.",
