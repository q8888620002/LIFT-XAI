  "summary": "Across the evaluated features, the hypothesis related to 'Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)' stands out for its strong mechanistic plausibility and evidence support. 'Age' is also robustly supported by clinical literature. 'Baseline Cardiovascular Risk' demonstrates a good understanding of potential subgroups, though there is some variability in its mechanisms. 'Smoking Status' and 'Physical Activity Level' are more speculative and require a more cautious approach. Overall, the proposed features cover a broad spectrum of potential effect modifiers with varying degrees of evidence support.",
