  "summary": "The assessed features for this intensive blood pressure control study in non-diabetic adults with hypertension and increased cardiovascular risk were primarily biological and demographic attributes influencing cardiovascular outcomes. Age and baseline cardiovascular risk are well-established modifiers in hypertension management and received higher scores due to strong evidence and plausible biological mechanisms. Other factors like sex, CKD status, and BMI have plausible mechanistic proposals but may vary in their evidence strength and clinical relevance. Overall, the hypotheses present actionable subgroups but should consider the individual and interacting effects of these features.",
