Mean SHAP signs are small for most features, indicating that average directional shifts in predicted net benefit are modest, while non-linear and interaction-driven heterogeneity is likely substantial (e.g., age \u00d7 NIHSS \u00d7 BP, AF \u00d7 severity). The refined hypotheses emphasize specific, evidence-based mechanisms by which these features may tilt the benefit\u2013risk balance of alteplase\u2014mainly by affecting recanalization probability, salvageable penumbra, and risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH)\u2014and propose concrete, IST-3\u2013feasible validation strategies.",

Combinations such as very old age, high BP, and antiplatelet use define high-sICH-risk strata where net benefit may narrow but is not necessarily abolished.
