  "summary": "Overall, the hypotheses related to age, time to treatment initiation, and stroke severity align well with known clinical evidence on treatment effect modifiers in ischemic stroke. Hypertension and neuroimaging markers also present plausible hypotheses but are somewhat less critical compared to the top features. The feature 'Time to Treatment Initiation' shows the strongest alignment with clinical literature, underscoring its high priority for further validation. Additional attention should be given to refining subgroup delineations and addressing caveats such as confounding by comorbidity and variability in symptom onset reporting.",
