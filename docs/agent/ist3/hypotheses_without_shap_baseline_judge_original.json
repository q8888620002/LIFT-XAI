  "summary": "The evaluation of proposed mechanisms for stroke patient treatment with alteplase revealed several clinically relevant insights. Age, NIHSS score, and time to treatment are top features, supported by strong mechanistic and literature evidence. Diabetes mellitus and previous stroke history feature lower in the importance as relatively less established effect modifiers in context. Overall, proposed mechanisms demonstrate strong biological plausibility, evidence alignment, and practical subgroup implications, though certain speculative elements require careful consideration. Validation plans are generally robust, yet some methodological concerns persist, particularly regarding potential confounding factors.",
