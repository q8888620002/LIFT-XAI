  "summary": "Across all 10 feature hypotheses, the proposed mechanisms, subgroup structures, and validation plans are highly consistent with contemporary stroke neurology and thrombolysis literature. Mechanistic reasoning is generally specific, biologically and clinically coherent, and appropriately caveated. The main cross-cutting limitation is that much of the evidence for treatment effect heterogeneity is observational or post\u2011hoc rather than from trials powered for interactions, and several mechanisms mix prognostic and predictive effects. Nonetheless, these are among the most biologically plausible and clinically actionable modifiers of alteplase effect.",
