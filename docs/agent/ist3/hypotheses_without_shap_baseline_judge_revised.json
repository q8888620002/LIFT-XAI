  "summary": "The evaluation of feature hypotheses in the context of acute ischemic stroke treatment with IV alteplase reveals diverse mechanistic plausibility, evidence support, and clinical relevance. 'Age' and 'Time to treatment' stand out as well-supported effect modifiers with strong clinical backing. 'Baseline NIHSS score' provides a reliable measure of initial stroke severity, influencing treatment decisions. 'Diabetes mellitus' and 'Previous stroke history' show moderate relevance with some speculative mechanisms.",
