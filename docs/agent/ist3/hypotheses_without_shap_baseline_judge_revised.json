  "summary": "Across all 10 feature hypotheses, the proposed mechanisms for alteplase treatment effect heterogeneity in acute ischemic stroke are biologically coherent, clinically well-interpreted, and largely aligned with contemporary trial and observational evidence. Subgroup structures closely mirror current guideline thresholds and stroke neurology practice. Validation plans are generally rigorous, using flexible interaction modeling, mediation analyses, and stratification by key co-determinants (time, core, LVO, collaterals). Caveats are appropriately detailed, with good awareness of confounding, selection bias, and measurement limitations. Overall, these feature-level hypotheses provide a strong and testable framework for mechanistic evaluation, with onset-to-needle time, baseline NIHSS, ASPECTS, collateral status, and glucose standing out as particularly high-priority modifiers.",
