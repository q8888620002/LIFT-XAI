  "summary": "This analysis evaluated several hypotheses regarding differential treatment effects of IV alteplase in acute ischemic stroke patients based on baseline characteristics like gender, age, glucose levels, stroke severity, and pre-existing conditions like atrial fibrillation or cardiovascular history. Most hypotheses addressed relevant clinical contexts, but the overall evidence strength and methodological rigor varied. Hypotheses involving common or well-established clinical concerns, such as glucose levels and age, generally received higher scores. In contrast, less clear or speculative hypotheses, such as those relying heavily on hypothetical biological mechanisms without robust clinical backing, scored lower.",
