  "summary": "The assessment focuses on identifying the most impactful modifiers associated with alteplase treatment in ischemic stroke patients. NIHSS is a well-supported, primary prognostic factor with clear biological, pharmacological, and statistical explanations for its effect modification role. Other features like dbprand and weight also present plausible, evidence-supported mechanistic pathways. Mechanisms for sbprand and antiplat_rand, while logical and moderately supported, tend to show less consensus around clinical importance. Overall, NIHSS and dbprand show the strongest alignment with existing literature, suggesting their prioritization in further exploration.",
