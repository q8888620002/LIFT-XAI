  "summary": "Across all 10 features, the proposed mechanistic explanations are generally biologically and clinically sound, well-aligned with the IST-3 context and broader alteplase literature, and accompanied by concrete validation ideas and thoughtful caveats. NIHSS, age, and stroke syndrome (TACI/PACI) are particularly strong as mechanistic TEH candidates; BP variables, weight, antiplatelets, AF, and GCS are plausible but more confounded and/or less specifically supported as true modifiers rather than risk markers. Methodological suggestions are mostly appropriate, although some mechanisms are speculative and several features (e.g., weight, GCS, PACI/TACI) may be underpowered or highly collinear with stronger predictors like NIHSS and age. Overall, the hypotheses warrant medium-to-high priority follow-up, with special emphasis on NIHSS, age, and stroke type as the most robust TEH dimensions.",
