  "summary": "The analysis evaluated five key feature hypotheses for their mechanistic plausibility, evidence alignment, subgroup implications, and caveat awareness in the context of alteplase treatment for acute ischemic stroke. The features, ranked by their importance in the model, were assessed across multiple dimensions considering the known literature and clinical practice. NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and diastolic blood pressure at randomization emerged as the most plausible and well-supported modifiers, with strong biological and clinical grounding. Weight, systolic blood pressure, and prior antiplatelet therapy showed plausible rationale but were more speculative or less prioritized in ranking.",
