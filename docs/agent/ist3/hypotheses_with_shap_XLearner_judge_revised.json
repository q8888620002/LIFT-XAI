  "summary": "Across the 10 features, the proposed mechanisms are biologically and clinically coherent, tightly linked to alteplase pharmacology and stroke pathophysiology, and largely aligned with existing trial evidence (especially IST-3 and pooled tPA data). Subgroup structures and validation plans are generally practical and statistically sound, with good acknowledgment of confounding and data limitations. Overall, NIHSS, SBP/DBP, age, OCSP subtypes (TACI/PACI), and AF emerge as high-value effect-modifier hypotheses that warrant prioritized validation; weight, GCS, and antiplatelet use are somewhat more confounded but still important. Methodological concerns mainly relate to residual confounding, non-linearity at data-sparse extremes, and overlap between clinical scales and syndromic classifications.",
