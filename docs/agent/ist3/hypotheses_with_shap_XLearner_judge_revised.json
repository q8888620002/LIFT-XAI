  "summary": "The assessment highlights the need to prioritize features based on their clinical support and treatment implications. The NIHSS and dbprand (diastolic blood pressure) are ranked highest, aligning with known moderating effects in stroke patient outcomes. Further investigation is warranted for features like weight and sbprand (systolic blood pressure) due to their pharmacological and physiological complexities. Antiplat_rand (pre-treatment antiplatelet therapy) requires careful examination due to theoretical risks in thrombolytic treatment. Overall, the recommendations align well with current literature but require further validation to ensure robustness.",
