  "summary": "The analysis across all feature hypotheses highlights the critical importance of NIHSS as the most well-supported and plausibly influential feature, consistent with the high ranking. However, further validation is recommended across all features due to potential methodological concerns such as the need for more explicit acknowledgment of trial-specific limitations and the necessity of diversified validation strategies. Overall, NIHSS and dbprand rank highest for priority follow-up.",
