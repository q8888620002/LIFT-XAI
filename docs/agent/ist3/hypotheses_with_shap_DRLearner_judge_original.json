  "summary": "The review assessed five feature hypotheses related to the efficacy of IV alteplase in acute ischemic stroke treatment. The feature NIHSS emerged as the top feature due to its well-documented relevance in stroke outcomes and supported biological mechanisms. While age held strong clinical weight, its proposed mechanisms and ranking were contextually challenging due to its commonality in stroke literature. Antiplatelet use requires more consolidation in the mechanistic grounding, despite its moderate rank, while stroke subtypes like TACI and dbpRand presented plausible mechanisms that deserve further exploration, albeit they ranked lower in importance.",
