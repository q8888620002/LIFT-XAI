  "summary": "In acute ischemic stroke treated within 6 hours, the most plausible modifiers of alteplase treatment effect cluster around: (1) tissue viability and recanalization potential (time from onset, baseline NIHSS, imaging core/ASPECTS, LVO and collateral status); (2) capacity to convert salvaged tissue into functional independence (age, pre-stroke mRS); and (3) vascular/hemostatic fragility (blood pressure, glucose, prior anticoagulant use, imaging signs of small-vessel disease). Features with higher SHAP importance likely capture one or more of these axes. Treatment effect heterogeneity probably arises mainly from the balance between penumbral salvage and hemorrhage/edema risk, modulated by premorbid functional and biological reserve. Because many of these variables are correlated (e.g., age with pre-stroke mRS; NIHSS with LVO and core; ASPECTS with collaterals), disentangling independent modification requires flexible, multivariable interaction modeling, careful handling of non-linear prognostic effects, and, where possible, mediation analyses using imaging-derived core/penumbra measures.",
