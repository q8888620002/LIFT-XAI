  "summary": "The assessment of hypotheses for the effectiveness of alteplase in acute ischemic stroke highlights NIHSS as the most critical feature, aligning with its established role in stroke prognosis and treatment response. Despite some strong mechanistic outlines for other features like antiplatelet use and stroke type, the ranking's adherence to clinical expectations varies. Subgroup definitions generally align with clinical applicability, although some validation plans require further concreteness. Caveats are acknowledged, but occasional lapses in recognizing potential biases and alternative mechanisms are present.",
