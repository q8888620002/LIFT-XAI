          "Substantial overlap between PACI and moderate NIHSS scores means that PACI may add limited independent information beyond continuous severity measures.",
          "Changes in modern treatment (e.g., expanded indications for thrombectomy into M2/distal occlusions) may reduce the relative role of alteplase alone in PACI-like presentations.",

    "cross_feature_patterns": "Several refined cross-feature themes emerge: (1) Severity\u2013territory interaction: NIHSS, GCS, and OCSP subtypes (TACI/PACI) jointly index stroke severity and involved territory. Moderate-severity anterior circulation strokes (often PACI, NIHSS ~6\u201314, GCS 13\u201315) appear biologically poised for substantial net benefit from alteplase, whereas very mild and ultra-severe (e.g., TACI with NIHSS \u226520 and low GCS) phenotypes may have smaller or more uncertain net gains. (2) Vascular fragility and hemorrhage risk: Age, SBP, DBP, and prior antiplatelet therapy cluster as markers of vascular damage and hemostatic compromise. Combinations such as very old age, high BP, and antiplatelet use define high-sICH-risk strata where net benefit may narrow but is not necessarily abolished. (3) Etiology and clot biology: AF and OCSP syndromes (especially TACI vs PACI) approximate underlying etiology (cardioembolic vs atherothrombotic vs small-vessel) and clot type, which plausibly influence recanalization probability and alteplase responsiveness. (4) Exposure and prognostic milieu: Weight interacts with alteplase dosing (dose cap) and co-varies with age, sex, and frailty, influencing both PK and recovery potential. (5) Multi-feature risk clusters: High-risk clusters such as very elderly, low-weight, hypertensive, antiplatelet-using TACI patients with AF potentially face high hemorrhage risk and limited rehab potential, while younger or middle-aged, moderately hypertensive PACI patients without heavy antithrombotic burden may realize large net benefit. Future analyses should focus on these combinatorial phenotypes using explicit interaction modeling and modern HTE methods rather than assessing features in isolation."
