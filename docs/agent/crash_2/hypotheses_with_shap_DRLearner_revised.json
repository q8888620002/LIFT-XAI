  "summary": "In the CRASH-2 dataset, several features relevant to trauma patients receiving tranexamic acid were found to have differential importance in predicting all-cause mortality. The key features include injury type, systolic blood pressure, clotting capacity, time to injury, and heart rate. Their importance is supported by a variety of biological, physiological, and pharmacological mechanisms, though refinement is advised to bolster specificity and evidential backing. The insights suggest specific subgroups for potential differential treatment effects, with enhanced validation strategies needed to confirm these observations.",
