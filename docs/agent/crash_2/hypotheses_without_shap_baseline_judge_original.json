  "summary": "All ten feature-level hypotheses are clinically interpretable and well-grounded in trauma/TXA literature, especially for time to TXA, hemorrhage severity, shock markers, and TBI. The mechanisms are generally specific, biologically plausible, and accompanied by appropriate caveats and thoughtful validation plans. The main cross-cutting weaknesses are: (1) occasional slippage from trial-based evidence (CRASH\u20112/3) to more speculative mechanistic claims, (2) heavy reliance on generic severity markers (ISS, lactate, SBP) that may act more as prognostic rather than true effect modifiers, and (3) some validation suggestions that will be challenging in typical datasets (e.g., detailed cause-specific mortality, viscoelastic phenotypes, instrumental variables). Time-from-injury is clearly the strongest and best-supported modifier and should be highest priority; hemorrhage severity (MTP/transfusion) and severe TBI status follow. Age, pre-injury meds, and prothrombotic history are plausible but more speculative as true modifiers of TXA\u2019s mortality effect. Overall caveat awareness and methodological thinking are strong across features.",
