  "summary": "The evaluation highlights the importance and plausibility of mechanisms underlying differential responses to tranexamic acid based on clinical features available in the CRASH-2 dataset. Each feature has been scored on different dimensions like mechanism plausibility, evidence alignment with existing literature, subgroup implications, etc. The scoring considered the coherence of biological mechanisms, the relative ranking of features according to clinical knowledge, the clarity of subgroup definitions, and the thoroughness of acknowledged caveats.",
