  "summary": "The assessment of these feature hypotheses has revealed substantial strengths in terms of biological plausibility and alignment with clinical literature, particularly for features like initial systolic blood pressure (SBP) and injury type, which are well-documented in trauma management. Despite these strengths, some features such as heart rate offer speculative reasoning on their pharmacological impact on TXA effectiveness. A notable concern is the potential for confounding especially regarding time to intervention and heart rate, which complicates isolating the effects of TXA.",
