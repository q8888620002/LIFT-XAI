  "summary": "Upon evaluating the set of hypotheses, the 'Effect of TXA in early treatment post-injury' hypothesis emerged as the most robust, given strong clinical plausibility, evidence support, and clarity in subgroup definition. Other hypotheses faced challenges, such as potential confounding and limitations in subgroup clarity. Across the hypotheses, common issues include the potential for unmeasured confounding due to observational data and the reliance on stratification without complete mechanistic insight.",
