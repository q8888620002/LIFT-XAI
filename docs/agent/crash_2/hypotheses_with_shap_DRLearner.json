The leading features include injury type, systolic blood pressure, clotting capacity, time to injury, and heart rate. Their importance is supported by a variety of biological, physiological, and pharmacological mechanisms and suggests specific subgroups that might experience differing treatment effects based on their baseline characteristics.",
