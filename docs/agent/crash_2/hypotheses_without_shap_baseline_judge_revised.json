  "summary": "Across these 10 revised hypotheses, the biological and clinical reasoning is consistently strong and well-aligned with current TXA/trauma literature (CRASH-2, CRASH-3, MATTERs, trauma-induced coagulopathy). Caveats around confounding, mediation, survivor bias, and measurement error are generally excellent. The biggest recurring weaknesses are: (1) occasional over-interpretation of moderate/weak evidence, (2) some subgroup cutpoints that are somewhat arbitrary or would be underpowered in typical datasets, and (3) reliance on sophisticated causal methods that may be challenging in many real-world registries without clear mention of sample size/practical constraints. Overall, these are high-quality, mechanistically coherent hypotheses that merit further study, especially for time to TXA, shock markers (SBP, lactate/base deficit), and hemorrhage severity (MTP/predicted massive transfusion).",
