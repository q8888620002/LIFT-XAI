Many hypothesized modifiers are grounded in CRASH-2, CRASH-3, MATTERs and subsequent trauma literature, though some subgroup-specific effects remain speculative.

(2) Features that shift the dominant cause of death away from bleeding (severe or unsurvivable TBI, extremely high ISS with catastrophic injuries, older age with complication-driven deaths) tend to attenuate TXA\u2019s observable impact on all-cause mortality, even if an effect on bleeding death persists. (3) Baseline pro-thrombotic or pharmacologically altered hemostatic states (prior VTE/cancer, pre-injury anticoagulant/antiplatelet use, older age) plausibly influence the balance between bleeding reduction and thrombosis risk, although existing trial data suggest that any absolute increase in thrombotic events from TXA is small. (4) Many of these variables\u2014time, SBP, lactate, ISS, MTP activation\u2014are intertwined markers of overall severity and embedded within care pathways; rigorous causal methods that respect temporal ordering, avoid conditioning on post-treatment mediators, and use cause-specific outcomes are essential to distinguish true biological effect modification from correlated risk stratification and system effects."
