  "summary": "Across these ten CRASH-2 feature hypotheses, the mechanistic reasoning is biologically coherent, clinically well-framed, and generally aligned with existing TXA/trauma literature. Timing, shock markers (HR, SBP, perfusion), and age are especially well-supported as sources of treatment effect heterogeneity; mechanism (blunt/penetrating), sex, RR, and GCS are treated more cautiously, with appropriate caveats about collinearity and limited direct evidence. Validation plans are concrete, use appropriate models, and correctly emphasize continuous and multivariable interaction analyses. Overall, these hypotheses merit further exploratory testing, particularly for timing and physiologic severity, but should not lead to restrictive TXA use beyond current guideline indications.",
