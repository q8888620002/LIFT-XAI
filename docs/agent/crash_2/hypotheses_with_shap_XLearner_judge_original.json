  "summary": "All ten feature-level hypotheses are biologically and clinically coherent and largely consistent with CRASH-2 knowledge. Timing, shock markers (HR, SBP, CRT), and injury type are the most mechanistically grounded modifiers; age, sex, RR, and GCS function more as baseline risk/phenotype markers with weaker direct TXA-specific biology. Validation plans are generally rigorous and appropriate, and caveats are thoughtfully articulated. None of the proposals clearly contradict established evidence that early TXA benefits most bleeding trauma patients regardless of mechanism, and all appropriately avoid suggesting major restriction of TXA use. Highest-priority follow-up features are timing, shock markers, and injury mechanism, which map closely onto known antifibrinolytic pharmacodynamics and trial data on time\u2011to\u2011treatment effects.",
