          "reasoning": "The abstract models nitrite, nitrate, and hemoglobin species kinetics and disposition in human circulation, focusing on erythrocytic uptake, metabolic conversion, and vasodilation-related NO generation. It does not examine heart rate, circulation dynamics related to heart rate changes, drug delivery in general, or TXA specifically, so it neither supports nor conflicts with the proposed speculative mechanism.",
          "key_findings": "Nitrite rapidly enters erythrocytes (rate constant 0.256 min^-1, half-life 2.71 min) and is quickly converted to iron-nitrosyl hemoglobin via NO formation (k = 2.02 min^-1, half-life 0.343 min). Nitrate formation occurs mainly in erythrocytes via nitrite-oxyhemoglobin reactions and is greater with intra-arterial vs intravenous nitrite administration. The study characterizes detailed pharmacokinetics of nitrite and its metabolites in humans but does not address heart rate effects or TXA delivery.",
